/**
 * struct diff_area - Discribes the difference area for one original device.
 * @kref:
 *	This structure can be shared between &struct tracker and &struct
 *	snapimage.
 * @orig_bdev:
 *	A pointer to the structure of an open block device.
 * @diff_storage:
 *	The same &struct diff_area can use the same diff_storage to store
 *	its data.
 * @chunk_shift:
 *	Power of 2 for chunk size. It's allow to set various chunk size for
 *	huge and small block device.
 * @chunk_count:
 *	Count of chunks. The number of chunks into which the block device
 *	is divided.
 * @chunk_map:
 *	A map of chunk. xarray can be too little on x32 systems. This creates
 *	a limit in the size of supported disks to 256 TB with a chunk size of
 *	65536 bytes. In addition, such a large array will take up too much
 *	space in memory.
 *	Therefore, the size of the chunk should be selected so that the size
 *	of the map is not too large, and the index does not exceed 32 bits.
 * @storing_chunks:
 *	A list of chunks that are waiting to be store sectors from memory to
 *	diff storage.
 *	Reading data from the original block device is performed in the context
 *	of the thread in which the filtering is performed. But storing data to
 *	diff storage is performed in workqueue.
 *	The chunks that need to be stored in diff storage are accumitale in
 *	this list.
 * @storage_list_lock:
 * 	Spin lock for the @storing_chunks list.
 * cache_list_lock:
 *      Spin lock for the @caching_chunks list.
 * @storing_chunks_work:
 *	The workqueue work item. This worker saves the chunks to the diff
 * 	storage.
 * @caching_chunks:
 *	After copying the sectors from the original block device to diff
 *	storage, the sectors are still located in memory. When the snapshot
 *	data is read or written, they also remain in memory for some time.
 * @caching_chunks_count:
 *	The number of chunks in the cache.
 * @caching_chunks_work:
 *	The workqueue work item which controls the cache size.
 * @corrupt_flag:
 *	The flag is set if an error occurred in the operation of the data
 *	saving mechanism in the diff area. In this case, an error will be
 *	generated when reading from the snapshot image.
 *
 * The &struct diff_area is created for each block device in the snapshot.
 * It is used to save the differences between the original block device and
 * the snapshot image. That is, when writing data to the original device,
 * the differences are copied as chunks to the difference storage.
 * Reading and writing from the snapshot image are also performed using
 * &struct diff_area.
