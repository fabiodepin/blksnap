/**
 * struct chunk - Elementary IO block.
 * @link:
 * 	?
 * @diff_area:
 * 	?
 * @number:
 * 	Sequential number of chunk.
 * @sector_count:
 * 	Numbers of sectors in current chunk this is especially true for the
 * 	last piece.
 * @state:
 * 	?
 * @lock:
 * 	Syncs access to the chunks fields: state, diff_buffer and diff_store.
 * 	The semaphore is blocked for writing if there is no actual data
 * 	in the buffer, since a block of data is being read from the original
 * 	device or from a diff storage.
 * 	If data is being read or written from the chunk buffer, the semaphore
 * 	must be blocked for reading.
 * 	The module does not prohibit reading and writing data to the snapshot
 * 	from different threads in parallel.
 * 	To avoid the problem with simultaneous access, it is enough to open
 * 	the snapshot image block device with the FMODE_EXCL parameter.
 * @diff_buffer:
 * 	Pointer to &struct diff_buffer. Describes a buffer in memory for
 * 	storing chunk data.
 * @diff_store:
 * 	Pointer to &struc diff_region. Describes a copy of the chunk data
 * 	on the difference storage.
 * This structure describes the block of data that the module operates with
 * when executing the COW algorithm and when performing IO to snapshot images.
