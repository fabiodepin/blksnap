/**
 * struct chunk - Minimum data storage unit.
 *
 * @cache_link:
 *	The list header allows to create caches of chunks.
 * @diff_area:
 *	Pointer to the difference area - the storage of changes for a specific device.
 * @number:
 *	Sequential number of the chunk.
 * @sector_count:
 *	Number of sectors in the current chunk. This is especially true
 *	for the	last chunk.
 * @lock:
 *	Binary semaphore. Syncs access to the chunks fields: state,
 *	diff_buffer, diff_region and diff_io.
 * @state:
 *	Defines the state of a chunk. May contain CHUNK_ST_* bits.
 * @diff_buffer:
 *	Pointer to &struct diff_buffer. Describes a buffer in the memory
 *	for storing the chunk data.
 * @diff_region:
 *	Pointer to &struct diff_region. Describes a copy of the chunk data
 *	on the difference storage.
 * @diff_io:
 *	Provides I/O operations for a chunk.
 *
 * This structure describes the block of data that the module operates
 * with when executing the copy-on-write algorithm and when performing I/O
 * to snapshot images.
 *
 * If the data of the chunk has been changed or has just been read, then
 * the chunk gets into cache.
 *
 * The semaphore is blocked for writing if there is no actual data in the
 * buffer, since a block of data is being read from the original device or
 * from a diff storage. If data is being read from or written to the
 * diff_buffer, the semaphore must be locked.
