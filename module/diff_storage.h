 * struct diff_storage - Difference storage.

 * @kref:
 *
 * @lock:
 *
 * @storage_bdevs:
 * 	List of opened block devices. Blocks for storing snapshot data can be
 * 	located on different block devices.
 * 	So, all opened block devices are located in this list.
 *	A storage from which blocks are allocated for storing chunks data.
 * @empty_blocks:
 * 	List of empty blocks on storage. This list can be updated while
 * 	holding a snapshot. It's allowing us to dynamically increase the
 * 	storage size for these snapshots.
 * @filled_blocks:
 * 	List of filled blocks. When the blocks from the empty list are filled,
 * 	we move them to the filled list.
 * @capacity:
 * 	Total amount of available storage space.
 * @filled:
 * 	The number of sectors already filled in.
 * @requested:
 * 	The number of sectors already requested from user-space.
 * @low_space_flag:
 *
 * @overflow_flag:
 *
 * @event_queue:
 * 	A queue of events to pass them to the user-space. Diff storage and his
 * 	owner can notify his snapshot about events like snapshot overflow,
 * 	low free space and snapshot terminated.
