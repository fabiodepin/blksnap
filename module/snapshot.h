 * struct snapshot - Snapshot structure.
 * @link:
 *	The list header allows to store snapshots in a linked list.
 * @kref:
 *	Protects the structure from being released during the processing of
 *	an ioctl.
 * @id:
 *	UUID of snapshot.
 * @is_taken:
 *	Flag that the snapshot was taken.
 * @diff_storage:
 *	A pointer to the difference storage of this snapshot.
 * @count:
 *	The number of block devices in the snapshot. This number
 *	corresponds to the size of arrays of pointers to trackers
 *	and snapshot images.
 * @tracker_array:
 *	Array of pointers to block device trackers.
 * @snapimage_array:
 *	Array of pointers to images of snapshots of block devices.
 *
 * A snapshot corresponds to a single backup session and provides snapshot
 * images for multiple block devices. Several backup sessions can be
 * performed at the same time, which means that several snapshots can
 * exist at the same time. However, the original block device can only
 * belong to one snapshot. Creating multiple snapshots from the same block
 * device is not allowed.
 *
 * A UUID is used to identify the snapshot.
